# Music Mixer Assignment Checkpoint 1 (Jackson & Jack)
	
This project was made for our Interactive Media Design class.

## Assignment Details (1st checkpoint)

For this portion of the assignment we have to layout a rough draft of the final project.

We have to include:

- Github repos for each project with team access (both members contributing).

- Readme file that describes the project, and any technical requirements for local
setup / development. <!-- (DONE) -->

- Initial commits from the developer and the designer: site shells / project structure (files
and folders up on the repos - can be empty with .gitkeep files).

- Dev notes for the projects.

- Pinterest or other collections of examples / inspiration.

## Features

Once this assignment is completed you'll be able to mix your own sick songs.
