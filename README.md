# Music Mixer Assignment Checkpoint 2 (Jackson & Jack)
	
This project was made for our Interactive Media Design class.

## Assignment Details (2nd checkpoint)

In this checkpoint we weren't able to figure out how to get the D&D feature to work correctly, we were able to get the first part to work
but nothing would come after the first part where it confirms that you have grabbed an image

## Features

Once this assignment is completed you'll be able to mix your own sick songs.
