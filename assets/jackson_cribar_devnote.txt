Here is the colours I am thinking for the site

Light Cyan/Blue: #1ecbe1

Bright Red: #ee1129

Light green: #0ef17c

I  think these colours contrast nicely and will have a good colour pallete for the site

site used: https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/

I wasn't able to get the drag and drop feature to work properly, it kept giving me a error when i went into inspect element
will look into how to fix it after the first part of the FIP is finished.
